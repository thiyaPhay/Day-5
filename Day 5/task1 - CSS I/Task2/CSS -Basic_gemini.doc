## Inline, Internal, and External CSS

**Inline CSS:**

* **Definition:** CSS rules are directly applied to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
* **Example:** `<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This is a paragraph with inline CSS.</p>`
* **Advantages:**
    - Quick and easy to apply styles to specific elements.
    - Good for one-off style changes.
* **Disadvantages:**
    - Poor maintainability: Styles are scattered throughout the HTML code.
    - Difficult to reuse styles across multiple elements.
    - Can make the HTML code less readable.

**Internal CSS:**

* **Definition:** CSS rules are placed within the `<head>` section of an HTML document, enclosed in a `<style>` tag.
* **Example:**
    ```html
    <head>
        <style>
            p {
                color: blue;
                font-size: 18px;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    ```
* **Advantages:**
    - Better organization and maintainability compared to inline CSS.
    - Styles can be reused across multiple elements within the same document.
* **Disadvantages:**
    - Styles are specific to the individual HTML document and cannot be reused across multiple pages.
    - Can make the HTML code larger and less readable.

**External CSS:**

* **Definition:** CSS rules are placed in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag.
* **Example:**
    ```html
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    ```
    **styles.css:**
    ```css
    p {
        color: green;
        font-size: 14px;
    }
    ```
* **Advantages:**
    - Excellent separation of concerns between content and presentation.
    - Reusable styles across multiple HTML documents.
    - Improved maintainability and readability of both HTML and CSS.
    - Faster page loading times, as CSS files can be cached by the browser.
* **Disadvantages:**
    - Requires additional setup to link the CSS file.
    - May introduce slight delays in initial page loading if the CSS file is large or slow to load.

**HTML Page Demonstrating All Three Methods:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CSS Methods</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>CSS Methods</h1>

    <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This paragraph has inline CSS.</p>

    <p>This paragraph has internal CSS.</p>

    <p>This paragraph has external CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

This HTML page demonstrates the three different methods of applying CSS: inline, internal, and external. Each paragraph has a different style applied using a corresponding method.
