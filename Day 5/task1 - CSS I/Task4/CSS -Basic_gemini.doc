### Task 4: Debugging CSS

**Common CSS Challenges**
1. **Overlapping Styles**: Multiple CSS rules may apply to the same element, leading to conflicts.
2. **Incorrect Specificity**: A less specific selector may be overridden by a more specific one.
3. **Missing Semicolons**: Omitting semicolons can disrupt entire style rules.

### Debugging Steps Using Browser Developer Tools

1. **Access Developer Tools**:
   - Right-click on an element in the browser and select "Inspect".
   
2. **Examine Element**:
   - Navigate to the "Elements" tab to view the HTML structure and associated styles.
   
3. **Review Applied Styles**:
   - The "Styles" pane displays which CSS rules are active. Strikethrough rules indicate they are overridden.

4. **Experiment with Live CSS Changes**:
   - Edit CSS directly in the "Styles" pane for immediate feedback on potential fixes.

### Example Issue and Debugging Process:
**Problem**: A paragraph is meant to be centered but isn't appearing as such.
- **Step 1**: Use developer tools to inspect the paragraph.
- **Step 2**: Check if a `text-align` rule is applied; if absent, add it in the live editor to test.
- **Step 3**: Once confirmed, update the CSS file accordingly.
