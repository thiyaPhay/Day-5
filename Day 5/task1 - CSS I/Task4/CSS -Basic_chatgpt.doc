### Task 4: How to Debug CSS

**Common CSS Issues:**
1. **Overlapping Styles**: Multiple CSS rules apply to the same element, causing conflicts.
2. **Incorrect Specificity**: The wrong selector takes precedence due to improper specificity.
3. **Missing Semicolons**: Omitting semicolons in CSS can break the entire rule set.

### Steps for Debugging with Browser Developer Tools

1. **Open Developer Tools**:
   - Right-click on the element in the browser and select "Inspect".
   
2. **Inspect Element**:
   - Select the "Elements" tab to view the HTML structure and corresponding styles.
   
3. **View Applied Styles**:
   - In the "Styles" pane, you can see which CSS rules are applied. Crossed-out rules indicate they are overridden by more specific or higher-priority rules.

4. **Live Test CSS Changes**:
   - You can edit CSS directly in the "Styles" pane to test changes live. This helps quickly identify and resolve issues.

### Example Issue and Debugging:
**Issue**: A paragraph is supposed to be centered, but it isnâ€™t.
- **Step 1**: Inspect the paragraph using the developer tools.
- **Step 2**: Check if a `text-align` rule is applied. If not, add it in the live editor to see if it resolves the issue.
- **Step 3**: Once confirmed, update the CSS file with the fix.
