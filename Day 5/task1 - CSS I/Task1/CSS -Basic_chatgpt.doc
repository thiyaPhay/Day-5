Task 1: CSS Basics

Prompt:

"Define CSS and explain its role in web development. Create a simple HTML document and include a basic CSS stylesheet that changes the background color, text color, and font size of the page. Explain each part of the CSS code and its effect on the HTML elements."

Solution:

Defining CSS:

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page.

Role of CSS in Web Development:

CSS plays a crucial role in web development by enabling developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. It allows for the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), making it easier to maintain and update the design of a website.

Creating a Simple HTML Document:

To create a simple HTML document, you can use any text editor like Notepad or Visual Studio Code. Here's an example of a basic HTML structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Simple Website</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS goes here */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Simple Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document with CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>

Including a Basic CSS Stylesheet:

To include a basic CSS stylesheet in your HTML document, you can add the CSS code within the <style> tags in the <head> section. Here's an example of how to change the background color, text color, and font size of the page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Simple Website</title>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Light gray background color */
            color: #333333; /* Dark gray text color */
            font-size: 18px; /* Font size of 18 pixels */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Simple Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document with CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>

Explanation of CSS Code:

In the CSS code above, we are targeting the <body> element using the body selector. Within the curly braces {}, we define the properties we want to change:

- background-color: #f0f0f0; sets the background color to light gray (#f0f0f0).
- color: #333333; sets the text color to dark gray (#333333).
- font-size: 18px; sets the font size to 18 pixels.

By applying these styles to the <body> element, we change the appearance of the entire web page.

Effect on HTML Elements:

The CSS code we added will affect all the HTML elements within the <body> tag. In this example, the background color, text color, and font size of the page will be changed. Specifically, the <h1> heading and <p> paragraph elements will inherit these styles.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
