## Task 7: Grid System and Breakpoints

### Answer:

A CSS grid system is a layout method that allows developers to create complex, responsive web page layouts by dividing the page into rows and columns. It provides a structured way to arrange content, making it easier to design and maintain web layouts.

### Bootstrap Grid System:

Bootstrap's grid system is based on a 12-column layout and uses a series of classes to define the width of columns at different screen sizes. It utilizes breakpoints to adjust the layout based on the screen size of the device.

### Example Responsive Layout Using Bootstrap:


<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4">Column 1</div>
      <div class="col-md-4">Column 2</div>
      <div class="col-md-4">Column 3</div>
    </div>
</div>


In this example:

- `container` is a wrapper class that centers the content and applies padding.

- `row` represents a row in the grid.

- `col-md-4` defines a column that spans 4 out of 12 columns on medium-sized screens and larger.

### Breakpoints:

Bootstrap uses breakpoints to determine when to apply different styles based on the screen size. The default breakpoints are:

- **xs:** Extra small devices (phones, less than 768px)

- **sm:** Small devices (tablets, 768px and up)

- **md:** Medium devices (desktops, 992px and up)

- **lg:** Large devices (larger desktops, 1200px and up)

- **xl:** Extra large devices (extra large desktops, 1400px and up)
