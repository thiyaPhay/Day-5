## Task 7: Grid System and Breakpoints

### Answer:
The **CSS grid system** is a layout method that allows developers to create complex responsive layouts easily by dividing space into rows and columns.

### Implementation Using Bootstrap:
Bootstrapâ€™s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout content.

### Example Responsive Layout Using Bootstrap:
```html
<div class="container">
   <div class="row">
       <div class="col-md-4">Column 1</div>
       <div class="col-md-4">Column 2</div>
       <div class="col-md-4">Column 3</div>
   </div>
</div>
```
In this example, the layout adapts based on screen size due to Bootstrap's responsive classes (`col-md-*`).
