## Task 1: CSS Processor

### Answer:

A CSS processor is a tool that helps developers write cleaner and more efficient CSS code. It allows you to use features that are not available in regular CSS, such as variables, functions, and mixins. This makes your CSS code easier to read, maintain, and scale.

Here are some popular CSS processors:

- **Sass:** Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass) is a powerful CSS extension language that adds features like variables, nesting, and mixins to CSS.

- **LESS:** Leaner Style Sheets (LESS) is another popular CSS preprocessor that offers similar features to Sass, such as variables, mixins, and functions.

- **Stylus:** Stylus is a more expressive CSS preprocessor that emphasizes concise syntax and powerful features.

### Advantages of using a CSS processor:

- **Improved Code Organization:** CSS processors allow you to organize your stylesheets more effectively using variables, nesting, and mixins. This makes your code easier to read and maintain.

- **Increased Efficiency:** Features like variables and mixins reduce code duplication, making your stylesheets more efficient and easier to update.

- **Enhanced Functionality:** CSS processors provide advanced features like functions, mathematical operations, and color manipulation, which are not available in regular CSS.

### Example (Sass):


// Define a variable for the primary color
$primary-color: #3498db;

// Use the variable to style a button
.button {
    background-color: $primary-color;

    // Use a Sass function to darken the color on hover
    &:hover {
      background-color: darken($primary-color, 10%);
    }
}
