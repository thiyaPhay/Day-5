## Task 3: Sass Basics

### Answer:
**Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)** is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. It offers features like variables, nested rules, mixins, and more.

### Differences from Regular CSS:
- **Nesting**: Allows nesting of selectors for better organization.
- **Partials & Imports**: Enables breaking styles into smaller files for modularity.

### Example:
**Sass File (`styles.scss`):**
```scss
@import 'variables';

nav {
    ul {
        list-style-type: none;
        
        li {
            display: inline-block;
            margin-right: 20px;
        }
    }
}
```

**Compiled CSS Output:**
```css
nav ul {
    list-style-type: none;
}

nav ul li {
    display: inline-block;
    margin-right: 20px;
}
```
Notable differences include structured nesting which makes it easier to read and maintain.
